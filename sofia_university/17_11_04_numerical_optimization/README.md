# Numerical Optimization for Large Scale Learning.

This lecture aims at giving an overview of the numerical optimization techniques used in machine learning.
The students interested in a more formal and academic approach can refer to the following links:
- [Pr. Strang's course on linear algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE7DDD91010BC51F8)
- [Pr. Strang's course on calculus](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBE9407EA64E2C318)

This folder contains the material related to the first lecture.
- [`build/slides.pdf`](build/slides.pdf) corresponds the slides
The rest is the (latex) source code used to generate the slides.
