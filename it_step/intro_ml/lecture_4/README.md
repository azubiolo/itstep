# Lecture 4: Clustering algorithm
This folder will contain the material related to the lecture on clustering algorithms.
`build/slides.pdf` corresponds the slides.
The rest is the (latex) source code used to generate the slides.

Here are a few extra links I mentioned during the course:
 - The k-mean clustering animation: http://shabal.in/visuals/kmeans/1.html
