# Lab 1: Introduction to Python
This folder contains the material related to the first lab. 
- `lab_1.py` contains the Python commands I showed during the demo
- `extra_execises_lab1.py` corresponds the extra exercises
Note that the code is not optimal in terms of computational speed and conciseness. It is meant to be easily readable.
