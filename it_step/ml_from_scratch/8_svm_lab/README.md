# Lecture 8: Support Vector Machines

This lab session consists in implementing the support vector algorithm based on what we have seen in [lecture 7](../7_classification)
This folder contains two Jupyter notebooks:
- [`svm_empty.ipynb`](svm_empty.ipynb) that will guide you though the implementation of the SVM algorithm.
- [`svm.ipynb`](svm.ipynb) which contains the solution to all the questions and exercises. (Not revealed yet).
